# fastvoted_rebirth

Reverse Engineering FastVoted which got shut down by Heroku in 2022
FastVoted is a real-time notification service for trending tech & startup posts from Product Hunt, Reddit, Hacker News and Twitter. We send these posts to all your messaging apps in real-time. We also have a Chrome extension that shows you the top 10 trending posts on GitHub, Hacker News and Product Hunt on every new tab.
Powered by [Devo] (<https://github.com/karakanb/devo>) Because I could do the cleaning with BeautifulSoup, but I wanted to get to your notificaton services faster.
Once Devo shuts me down, I will create my own scraping engines.
